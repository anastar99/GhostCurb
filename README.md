# GhostCurb

A system designed to provide alerts/information on
the status of the prling in front onf my house.

Getting a parking spot that is not your driveway
in my neighborhood is hard so i built this app to help me get a parking spot
or atleast collrcr data and analyze parking patterns. which you can learn a lot from.

we use a:
- esp32 camera to monitor the parking spot
- firebase real time database to upload parking info
- mobile app created using expo
